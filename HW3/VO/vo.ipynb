You can use the ORB Feature to do the feature matching:\n","    `orb = cv2.ORB_create()` to create the ORB object\n","    and then `orb.detectAndCompute()` to find the keypoints and descriptors on both frames\n","\n","2. You can use brute-force matcher to match ORB descriptors:\n","    `bf = cv2.BFMatcher(cv2.NORM_HAMMING, crossCheck=True)`\n","\n","3. After matching the descriptors, sort the matched keypoints.\n","\n","4. Draw matches on the two images using the `cv2.drawMatches()` function.\n","\n","5. Compute the essential matrix using the `cv2.findEssentialMat()` function. Note that you need the matching points and the instrinsics for this function. \n","\n","6. Extract the rotation and translation from the essential matrix using the `cv2.recoverPose()` function.\n","\n","7. Multiply the estimated rotation and translation with the previous rotation and translation. Initialize rotation to identity and translation to zeros on the first frame.\n","\n","8. Display the current image with the keypoints on it using the `cv2.drawKeypoints()` function.\n","\n","9. Update the previous rotation and translation as the current rotation and translation.\n","\n","10. Draw the estimated trajectory as blue and ground-truth trajectory as green.
